#Spitfire Server

##Standard Express generated application + the spitfire-express middlware.

###NOTE: Will NOT generate endpoints on the fly when the environment is set to 'production'.  This is a security measure so people can't hit your API and generate endpoints "willy-nilly" when in production.
